I am a software developer based in London. I have well developed interests in JVM performance, and aspirational interests in modeling software systems. 

I am available for consulting projects (software development and/or performance analysis/tuning, strictly outside IR35) remotely or in London/South East England: [contact me](richard@openkappa.co.uk) to discuss projects.

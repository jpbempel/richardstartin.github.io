<blockquote>These posts are my notes revisiting topics I once knew or was taught, but have forgotten, in a pragmatic way. 
I don't have professional expertise in the subject matter; the content may be superficial, wrong, or misleading, but <a href="https://github.com/richardstartin/richardstartin.github.io" target="_blank">corrections</a> are welcome. 
The topics will all be related to the characterisation, capture, and modeling of information system dynamics.
  
Where no sources are cited, the content is derived from personal lecture notes.
